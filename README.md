# Clueso.io Clone – Full Stack Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Full Stack Technical Assignment.
The goal of this assignment is to build a functional clone of Clueso.io by
replicating its core features, workflows, and user experience.

This project focuses on product understanding, clean technical execution,
system integration, and professional delivery.

---

## Assignment Objective
Clone the core functionality of Clueso.io by extending a starter codebase
and implementing key workflows such as authentication, feedback collection,
dashboard experience, and AI-powered insights.

---

## Core Features Implemented
- User onboarding and authentication
- Dashboard experience similar to Clueso.io
- Feedback collection and management
- AI-powered insights (mock implementation)
- Frontend–backend system communication

---

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a modular full-stack architecture:

- Frontend Application
- Backend Node.js Service
- AI Integration Component
- Browser Extension Layer

Each component is designed with clear separation of concerns and scalable design.
